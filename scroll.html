        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
        five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a
        reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
        at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
        desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
        their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
        over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
        humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular
        belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
        of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
        Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
        Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
        interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
        Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem
        Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form,
        by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need
        to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of
        text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
        predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
        with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum
        which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
        free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
        etc.In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate
        clients corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual
        content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with
        content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be
        distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a
        newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the text,
        disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to
        be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate
        environments. Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since
        the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.On the
        other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
        are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
        so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
        are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
        duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
        shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
        to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
        and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every
        pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
        circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
        business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated
        and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
        matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
        other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
        pains.Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That's what is
        Lorem Ipsum to many—it rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It's
        unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it seems to
        seek your attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the
        real thing, wine without sulfur based preservatives, real butter, not
        margarine, and so we'd like our layouts and designs to be filled with
        real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value. The
        toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forgot to
        shop for foods, the paint you may slap on your face to impress the new
        boss is your business. But what about your daily bread? Design comps,
        layouts, wireframes—will your clients accept that you go about things
        the facile way? Authorities in our business will tell in no uncertain
        terms that Lorem Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever. Not
        so fast, I'd say, there are some redeeming factors in favor of greeking
        text, as its use is merely the symptom of a worse problem to take into
        consideration. You begin with a text, you sculpt information, you chisel
        away what's not needed, you come to the point, make things clear, add
        value, you're a content person, you like words. Design is no
        afterthought, far from it, but it comes in a deserved second. Anyway,
        you still use Lorem Ipsum and rightly so, as it will always have a place
        in the web workers toolbox, as things happen, not always the way you
        like it, not always in the preferred order. Even if your less into
        design and more into content strategy you may find some redeeming value
        with, wait for it, dummy copy, no less. Consider this: You made all the
        required mock ups for commissioned layout, got all the approvals, built
        a tested code base or had them built, you decided on a content
        management system, got a license for it or adapted open source software
        for your client's needs. Then the question arises: where's the content?
        Not there yet? That's not so bad, there's dummy copy to the rescue. But
        worse, what if the fish doesn't fit in the can, the foot's to big for
        the boot? Or to small? To short sentences, to many headings, images too
        large for the proposed design, or too small, or they fit in but it looks
        iffy for reasons the folks in the meeting can't quite tell right now,
        but they're unhappy, somehow. A client that's unhappy for a reason is a
        problem, a client that's unhappy though he or her can't quite put a
        finger on it is worse. But. A big but: Lorem Ipsum is not t the root of
        the problem, it just shows what's going wrong. Chances are there wasn't
        collaboration, communication, and checkpoints, there wasn't a process
        agreed upon or specified with the granularity required. It's content
        strategy gone awry right from the start. Forswearing the use of Lorem
        Ipsum wouldn't have helped, won't help now. It's like saying you're a
        bad designer, use less bold text, don't use italics in every other
        paragraph. True enough, but that's not all that it takes to get things
        back on track. So Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily) There's lot of
        hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words
        in an old language. The villagers are out there with a vengeance to get
        that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks, wanting to tar and
        feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame. One of the
        villagers, Kristina Halvorson from Adaptive Path, holds steadfastly to
        the notion that design can’t be tested without real content: I’ve heard
        the argument that “lorem ipsum” is effective in wireframing or design
        because it helps people focus on the actual layout, or color scheme, or
        whatever. What kills me here is that we’re talking about creating a user
        experience that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The
        entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS. If that's
        what you think how bout the other way around? How can you evaluate
        content without design? No typography, no colors, no layout, no styles,
        all those things that convey the important signals that go beyond the
        mere textual, hierarchies of information, weight, emphasis, oblique
        stresses, priorities, all those subtle cues that also have visual and
        emotional appeal to the reader. Rigid proponents of content strategy may
        shun the use of dummy copy but then designers might want to ask them to
        provide style sheets with the copy decks they supply that are in tune
        with the design direction they require. Or else, an alternative route:
        set checkpoints, networks, processes, junctions between content and
        layout. Depending on the state of affairs it may be fine to concentrate
        either on design or content, reversing gears when needed. Or maybe not.
        How about this: build in appropriate intersections and checkpoints
        between design and content. Accept that it’s sometimes okay to focus
        just on the content or just on the design. Luke Wroblewski, currently a
        Product Director at Google, holds that fake data can break down in real
        life: Using dummy content or fake information in the Web design process
        can result in products with unrealistic assumptions and potentially
        serious design flaws. A seemingly elegant design can quickly begin to
        bloat with unexpected content or break under the weight of actual
        activity. Fake data can ensure a nice looking layout but it doesn’t
        reflect what a living, breathing application must endure. Real data
        does. Websites in professional use templating systems. Commercial
        publishing platforms and content management systems ensure that you can
        show different text, different data using the same template. When it's
        about controlling hundreds of articles, product pages for web shops, or
        user profiles in social networks, all of them potentially with different
        sizes, formats, rules for differing elements things can break, designs
        agreed upon can have unintended consequences and look much different
        than expected. This is quite a problem to solve, but just doing without
        greeking text won't fix it. Using test items of real content and data in
        designs will help, but there's no guarantee that every oddity will be
        found and corrected. Do you want to be sure? Then a prototype or beta
        site with real content published from the real CMS is needed—but you’re
        not going that far until you go through an initial design cycle. Lorem
        Ipsum actually is usefull in the design stage as it focuses our
        attention on places where the content is a dynamic block coming from the
        CMS (unlike static content elements that will always stay the same.)
        Blocks of Lorem Ipsum with a character count range provide a obvious
        reminder to check and re-check that the design and the content model
        match up. Kyle Fiedler from the Design Informer feels that distracting
        copy is your fault: If the copy becomes distracting in the design then
        you are doing something wrong or they are discussing copy changes. It
        might be a bit annoying but you could tell them that that discussion
        would be best suited for another time. At worst the discussion is at
        least working towards the final goal of your site where questions about
        lorem ipsum don’t. Summing up, if the copy is diverting attention from
        the design it’s because it’s not up to task. Typographers of yore didn't
        come up with the concept of dummy copy because people thought that
        content is inconsequential window dressing, only there to be used by
        designers who can’t be bothered to read. Lorem Ipsum is needed because
        words matter, a lot. Just fill up a page with draft copy about the
        client’s business and they will actually read it and comment on it. They
        will be drawn to it, fiercely. Do it the wrong way and draft copy can
        derail your design review. Asking the client to pay no attention Lorem
        Ipsum isn't hard as it doesn’t make sense in the first place, that will
        limit any initial interest soon enough. Try telling a client to ignore
        draft copy however, and you're up to something you can't win. Whenever
        draft copy comes up in a meeting confused questions about it ensue.
        Summing up, really: Lorem Ipsum is a tool that can be useful, used
        intentionally it may help solve some problems. If you go about content
        strategy the wrong way, fix that problem.
